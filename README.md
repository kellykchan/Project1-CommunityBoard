## Notes

One of the trickier parts was getting the images to look clean and consistent. Since they all had different shapes and sizes, the cards looked kind of messy at first. I ended up using 'object-fit: cover' and setting a fixed height on the images so they would all line up nicely. That made everything feel a lot more balanced and helped the layout look more put together.
